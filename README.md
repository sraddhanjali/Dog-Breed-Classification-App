Develop algorithm that can be used as a part of a mobile or web app. Any 
user supplied images are taken as input to either detect dog or human in 
the image. If dog is present in the image, we supply the estimated dog's 
breed and if a human is detected, we provide the nearest resembling dog 
breed to that human.
